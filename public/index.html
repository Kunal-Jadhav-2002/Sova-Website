        <h2 id="mission-heading">Our Mission: Protecting the Hands That Shape Our Future</h2>
        <p id="mission-text">
          Every day, millions of unsung heroes—farmers, laborers, and workers—are on the front lines of life. Their hands, calloused and worn, are the driving force behind the crops we eat, the homes we live in, and the communities we thrive in. But these hands suffer in silence. They endure pain, injuries, and relentless toil without the protection they desperately need.  
          <br><br>
          At <strong>Sova</strong>, we don’t just make gloves. We create a lifeline. A lifeline for those whose hands bear the weight of the world. Our gloves are more than just tools—they are shields. Shields against harsh conditions, against injury, and against the strain of endless labor. We’re bringing a revolution in hand care, empowering those who build, grow, and create the world we live in.
          <br><br>
          Imagine the power of gifting a pair of Sova gloves to someone who needs it. You’re not just giving gloves—you’re gifting protection, comfort, and dignity. Together, we can transform lives and ensure that every hand gets the care it deserves.
          <br><br>
          Join us in this journey. Let’s make a stand for the hands that shape the future. Let’s protect them, empower them, and honor them with Sova gloves.

                <h2>Refund and Cancellation</h2>

                <p>Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately after placing the order.
                    However, the cancellation request may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the

                    The request will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and determined the same at his

                    that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring it to the

                    Service Team after looking into your complaint will take an appropriate decision.</p>

                <p>In case of complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from manufacturers, please refer
                    the issue to them. In case of any Refunds approved by the Sova Gloves, it’ll take 9-15 Days days for the
